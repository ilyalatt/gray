# Gray

It is a simple script that plays scheduled tracks at specific time everyday.
It is a tribute to the flash mob in Belarus.
Every day at 19:00 people play music against repressions.
However it is an inconvenient time for me.
I am not at home at 19:00 usually.
So this script helps to solve the issue.

## Setup

Install `python3.6`, `pipenv`, `ffmpeg`.
Run `make run`.
You need to place tracks in directories like `playlist/2020-07-26`.
Tracks are played by name order.
It allows to set needed order by prefixes like `01 Gray.mp3`, `02 Peremen.mp3`.
